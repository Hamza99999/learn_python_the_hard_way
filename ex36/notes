- a scenario needs to hold a number of pieces of data
    - description of environment
    - allowable actions a player can take
    - ?? the outcome of those actions ??
        - or, there is a standard set of actions, and each location allows for
          some subset of those actions
    - an event to overcome (or not). Eg. a troll can be killed, but a
      blacksmith can be used for his trade any number of times.
        - the effect of overcoming the event
        - the newly allowable actions
